The hosts of the show through Season 8 were Home Maven: Patrick Brown, Decor Maven: Wanda Colon and Cooking Maven: Jamika Pessoa. The featured guest of each week's show were nominated by their friends or family on the <i>Home Made Simple</i> website. Friends help the featured guest with projects in their home with guidance from the hosts. Common projects on the show are easy meals, minor fix-its, room organization and interior decorating. The Home Mavens share expert tips in each episode. Products from Mr. Clean, Febreze, Dawn, Cascade and Swiffer, the sponsoring brands, are used throughout the show.</p><p>The show moved to Oprah Winfrey Network at the start of Season 9.
