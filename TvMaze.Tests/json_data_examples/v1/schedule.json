            "summary": "<p>\"<i><strong>Hannity & Colmes\"</strong></i> was a live television show on Fox News Channel in the United States, hosted by Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes, who respectively presented a conservative and liberal perspective. The series premiered on October 7, 1996, and the final episode aired on January 9, 2009. It was the precursor to the <i>Hannity </i>program, which airs in the same time slot. The show offered Hannity's conservative views and Colmes's liberal views incorporated into a current news story, or in conjunction with a featured guest.</p><p>In addition to politics, the show featured debate about soft news stories, such as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal or the death of Anna Nicole Smith, or one-on-one interviews with politicians, commonly with the host who most closely shared the guest's political ideology. The show's format resembled a former CNN show called <i>Crossfire</i>, which similarly had co-hosts on both the left and right.</p><p>Fox announced on November 24, 2008 that Alan Colmes would leave the show at the end of the year, but he remains a commentator on Fox News, runs the blog Liberaland, and makes occasional appearances on other programs like <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, and Shovio.com's <i>TalkBackTV</i>. On December 11, it was announced that Hannity would take over the time slot alone with a new show simply titled <i>Hannity</i>, which would have a format closer to his weekend program <i>Hannity's America</i>. January 9, 2009 was the last airing of <i>Hannity & Colmes</i>, with January 12 marking the beginning of the new <strong><em>\"<i>Hannity\"</i> </em></strong>program.</p>",

It's co-anchored by former ABC News correspondent John Berman and CNN's chief business correspondent Christine Romans. The slogan for <strong><em>\"</em></strong><strong><em>Early Start with John Berman and Christine Romans\"</em></strong> is \"News from A to Z\", but its viewers can expect to see the same formula that morning news shows have used for years, and that is a mix of hard news, entertainment segments and some surprises thrown in along the way. The program was originally co-anchored by Ashleigh Banfield and Zoraida Sambolin.</p>",

The program features late-breaking news stories, national weather forecasts and sports highlights. Since 2013, it has been anchored by Anne Marie Green, who concurrently anchored the CBS late-night news program <i>Up to the Minute</i> until its cancellation in September 2015. The program is broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time (airing in the early timeslot to accommodate CBS stations that start their local morning newscasts at 4:30 a.m.), and is transmitted in a continuous half-hour tape delayed loop until 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, when <i>CBS This Morning</i> begins in the Pacific Time Zone. The program usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most CBS stations, although in the few markets where a morning newscast is not produced by the CBS station, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of <i>This Morning</i>. The show is updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, while stations throughout the network will join <i>CBS This Morning</i> in all time zones past that time at their local discretion or network orders for live coverage.</p>",

SportsCenter anchor Mike Greenberg's Odd Couple relationship with former NFL player Mike Golic is the main focus on the show, and that illustrates their different views on sports. Mike Greenberg is portrayed as a typical nerd, who was not involved in athletic activites, and was constantly picked on by bullies. On the other side of the spectrum, Mike Golic is shown as the tough man, who isn't afraid to speak his mind, and isn't very intellectual. On most of the shows, the two argue over trivial things. One notable argument lasted for days, when Golic didn't clean out Greenberg's blender after using it (Greenberg is also portrayed as a neat freak.) Former professional athletes such as Mike Ditka and Mark Schlereth provide insight on the issues discussed.</p>",

Debuting on April 14, 1997, the program's primarily targets the Hispanic population in the United States. It is broadcast from the network's studios in Miami, Florida, and is currently hosted by Karla Martínez, Johnny Lozada, Alan Tacher, Ana Patricia González, Lourdes Ramos, Ximena Córdoba, Lourdes Stephan and Alejandro Chabán. Other reporters or celebrities also provide entertainment and gossip segments, and will occasionally appear as guest hosts if one of the regular hosts is unavailable (for instance, actress Angélica Vale has appeared frequently during the show's run). The show also features contributors that cover a variety of topics such as immigration, technology, diet, exercise and personal motivation. Among the permanent and occasional contributors of the show are Dr. Mario Lovo (immigration), Ariel Coro (technology), Claudia Molina (exercise), Alejandro Chabán (weight loss), Ismael Cala, María Marín and Alberto Sardiñas (motivation), among many others.</p><p>The program airs weekdays from 7:00 to 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time; as Univision holds complete responsibility for its affiliates' programming, the network does not tape delay <i>¡Despierta América!</i> individually by U.S. time zone (only running a delayed broadcast for the network's Pacific Time feed). Although similar in format to English language competitors <i>Good Morning America</i> and <i>Today</i>, <i>¡Despierta América!</i> maintains more of a focus on interviews, and entertainment and feature stories; news headlines are generally limited to a segment that airs each half-hour, and national weather segments only appear once an hour during the first three hours of the broadcast (compared to the half-hourly weather updates that appear on other national morning news programs).</p>",

Copeland has been strongly identified with preaching a prosperity and abundance message, commonly referred to as the prosperity gospel over the last 45 years. His Tarrant County, Texas-based Kenneth Copeland Ministries (KCM) advocates daily application of the \"Word of God\", meaning the Bible. KCM is a teaching ministry that specializes in biblical teaching that focuses on faith, love, healing, prosperity and restoration through diverse media, such as television, books, CD and DVD. KCM's motto is Jesus is Lord based upon Romans 10:9. </p><p>Historically, Copeland's ministry held a number of conventions across the United States which lasted anywhere from three to six days. The number of longer set conventions has waned in recent years, although KCM still holds an annual Believer's Convention in his hometown of Fort Worth during the week of July 4. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, along with ministry friends including some family members, also preach at other conventions and conferences throughout the world. These events stream live on Copeland's website, kcm.org, as well as being shown on Christian television stations such as God TV and the Daystar Television Network. Portions of recorded conferences are shown Sundays. The Monday through Friday television broadcasts feature a Copeland family member, either alone or with another minister, discussing subjects from The Holy Bible. Most of these episodes are available on BVOV.tv!</p>",

After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the \"Showcase Showdown.\" The two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. A trio of models presents the prizes.</p>",

It is presented by Tyler Mathisen, Brian Sullivan, Amanda Drury and Melissa Lee. Bill Griffeth anchored the program alone from 1996 to 2002. Caruso-Cabrera joined the program as Griffeth's original co-presented from February 4, 2002, to December 5, 2003, before being replaced by Sue Herera starting on December 8, 2003. Caruso-Cabrera and Dennis Kneale appeared on the show regularly in their respective analyst capacities until both became full co-presenters in 2009. Mathisen joined the program in late 2009, after Griffeth's leave of absence began.<i>Power Lunch</i> used to air for two hours (noon to 2 ET) until June 7, 2010, when it moved to 1 ET and had its running time cut in half, from 2 hours to 1 hour, to make room for <i>The Strategy Session</i> at noon ET and the <i>Fast Money Halftime Report</i> at 12:30 ET. The show became a 2-hour program once again on February 9, 2015, as the running time is now from 1-3 p.m. ET, replacing <i>Street Signs</i>, which had its final episode on February 6, 2015. Sullivan and Drury, both of whom previously co-anchored <i>Street Signs</i>, joined <i>Power Lunch</i> February 9, along with current <i>Fast Money</i> and <i>Options Action</i> host Melissa Lee. They replace Herera, who left <i>Power Lunch</i> three days earlier. On October 13, 2014, <i>Power Lunch</i> was launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of CNBC's network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox format.</p>",

            "summary": "<p><i><strong>\"Outside the Lines\"</strong></i>, or also referred to as <i>OTL</i>, is an American television program on ESPN that looks \"outside the lines\" and examines critical issues in mostly American sports on and off the field of play. The primary host of the show, since it began, is long-time sportscasting veteran Bob Ley along with contributors and fill-in hosts to the show which include Jeremy Schaap, Mark Schwarz, T.J. Quinn, and Kelly Naqi. The program airs for 30 minutes Monday through Friday at 1:00 PM ET on ESPN and on Sunday at 9:00 AM ET on ESPN. The show premiered in 1990 as a monthly one-hour program with Bob Ley as host. After a noticeable increase in television ratings, ESPN decided to expand the program for thirty minutes to their Sunday morning lineup at 9:30 am ET, where the show covered one or two of the more notable sporting news stories of the week.</p><p>After the ratings continued to grow, on May 12, 2003, ESPN premiered <i>Outside the Lines Nightly</i>. The Sunday morning program was still seen at 9:30 am ET, along with the nightly show that was seen during <i>The Trifecta</i> at midnight and noon on ESPN. On June 12, 2006, ESPN announced that <i>Outside the Lines Nightly</i> (now <i>Outside the Lines First Report</i>) would be moved to 3:30 pm ET as part of the afternoon lineup on ESPN, and eventually moved to 3:00 pm ET. Following the addition of <i>NFL Insiders</i> to ESPN's schedule on August 5, 2013, the weekday <i>OTL</i> program (which by this point carried the same name as the Sunday series) began to be moved to air in the late afternoons on ESPN2 during the football season; it returns to the 3 p.m. ET slot on ESPN after the Super Bowl and airs there until the start of training camp in August, with occasional moves to ESPNEWS depending on sporting events scheduled for ESPN2. On September 8, 2014, it began to be preceded on ESPN2 by <i>Olbermann</i>, with Keith Olbermann and Ley having a cross-talk segment with each other leading out of <i>Olbermann</i> and into <i>OTL</i>; <i>OTL</i> moved back to its regular 3 p.m. ESPN berth at the start of February 2015.</p><p>The program, both in the weekday and Sunday form, usually runs commercial-free from the top of the hour to 22 minutes past the hour, with the program's commercial load taking up most of the last eight minutes and ending with a note of video and audio on-demand options and promotions for primetime programming, along with Twitter and Facebook responses to that day's listed discussion hashtag.</p>",

            "summary": "<p><i>Mad Money</i> is an American finance television program hosted by Jim Cramer that began airing on CNBC on March 14, 2005. Its main focus is investment and speculation, particularly in publicly traded stocks. In a notable departure from the CNBC programming style prior to its arrival, <i>Mad Money</i> presents itself in an entertainment-style format rather than a news broadcasting one. Cramer defines \"mad money\" as the money one \"can use to invest in stocks ... not retirement money, which you want in 401K or an IRA, a savings account, bonds, or the most conservative of dividend-paying stocks.\" <i>Mad Money</i> replaced Dylan Ratigan's <i>Bullseye</i> for the 6 p.m. Eastern Time slot. On January 8, 2007, CNBC began airing reruns of the show at 11 p.m. Eastern Time, on Monday through Friday, and at 4 a.m. Eastern Time, on Saturdays.</p><p>In March 2012, the program became a part of what was formerly branded as <i>NBC All Night</i> in the nominal 3:07 a.m. ET/2:07 a.m. timeslot on weeknights, replacing week-delayed repeats of NBC's late night talk shows. In that form, only the video for the program was presented on a 16:9 screen with gray branded windowboxing andpillarboxing, with all enhanced business information, including the CNBC Ticker, removed. Because of the scheduling of local station's 4 a.m. or 4:30 a.m. newscasts to air<i>Early Today</i> depending on how a station schedules its overnight programming (even if it airs at the regular time in the Eastern and Pacific time zones for instance, seven minutes would have to be cut-off to fit in <i>Early Today</i> and a local newscast starting at 4:30 a.m.), it is subject to local pre-emption, including by NBC O&O's.</p><p>On August 4, 2014, <i>Mad Money</i> was first broadcast in full 1080i HD, resulting in the removal of the sidebar that was seen on all of CNBC's other trading-day programming, until the sidebar itself was permanently removed altogether on October 13, 2014. The NBC presentation displays the native widescreen HD picture, albeit with the CNBC Ticker space still filled in with gray windowboxing.</p>",

Fans will be able to submit questions via #WUTV across social media, report current conditions in their area, contribute to the creation of show segments, access behind-the-scenes live-stream video via wunderground.com and participate in weather roundtables live on air. Science-grounded and community-based, the Weather Underground network includes more than 120,000 personal weather stations that feed into WU's widely used website and apps, enhancing their strength at local forecasting.</p><p>The new show will appeal to WU members as well as everyone's inner weather geek, with insights into breaking weather events and the science behind forecasting. The show's basement-style set will reflect WU's quirky, independent style, with a full bar, lounge chairs and state-of-the-art 3D visuals. Viewers will also get to know the WunderFriends, four characters created by WU artists that will come to life in animated form.  \"Weather Underground\" will be hosted by Mike Bettes, an Emmy Award-winning meteorologist and storm tracker.</p>",

News Live</strong></i>, is the flagship entertainment newscast of the E! network in the United States. Without italics, it is the name of the network's entertainment-news division. The newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reports on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, and some news about the industry in general. The program first aired on September 1, 1991 and was originally hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named <i>E! News Live</i>). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by Jason Kennedy. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), leaving others to question if she would return. But Rancic reassured her fans by releasing a statement saying she had just signed a three-year deal with E! News and Fashion Police. During her leave, her anchoring duties were taken over by Catt Sadler. From 2006 until late 2010, <i>The Daily 10</i>, hosted by Sal Masekela, Catt Sadler, and at one point Debbie Matenopoulos, aired following <i>E! News</i>.</p><p>On September 21, 2010, E! announced the cancellation of <i>The Daily 10</i>. At this time, it was announced that <i>E! News</i> would be expanded to a one-hour format. The expansion became effective beginning on October 25, 2010, making it one of two entertainment news programs to have weekday editions that air in an hour-long format,HLN's <i>Showbiz Tonight</i> being the other. The series also debuted a new news set and began broadcasting in 16:9 high definition, downconverted to 4:3 letterbox (with pillarboxing for 4:3 SD video) on the channel's primary SD feed.[1] Some talent previously featured on <i>The Daily 10</i>, including Catt Sadler, Clinton Sparks and Robbie Laughlin, were integrated into <i>E! News</i>, along with the addition of a segment called <i>The Daily 10 Take</i>, along with the inclusion of some former <i>Daily 10</i> segments.</p><p><i>E! News</i> does not produce episodes on major holidays, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas, with special pre-taped programs, the show's weekend edition or other E! programs airing instead, depending on where the holiday falls. </p>",

Mom Beverly is a classic \"smother,\" an overbearing, overprotective matriarch who loves her delicious kids, but still rules this brood with 100% authority and zero sense of boundaries. Dad Murray is gruff and sometimes oblivious, parenting with half his attention span but all his heart. Sister Erica is popular and terrifying, doing her best to cover up that she's the smartest of the clan. Barry is a passionate dreamer, who maybe dreams a little too big and who always gets the short end of the stick. Adam is the youngest, a camera-wielding future director who's navigating first love, and growing up with his family. Rounding out the family is beloved grandfather Al \"Pops\" Solomon, the wild man of the clan, a shameless Don Juan who's learning as much from his family as he teaches them.</p>",

It is usually taped between 5:00 and 7:00 PM Eastern Time and airs weekdays at 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM. The show is recorded \"live to tape\", meaning that the recording breaks for commercials as if the show was actually on the air while being recorded. Some guests are interviewed before the \"live to tape\" period and are slotted in the program as appropriate.</p><p>O'Reilly and his producers discuss potential topics twice a week. A producer will research the story and book guests for O'Reilly, and an information packet will be produced with possible angles for O'Reilly to explore. For each show, O'Reilly, with the assistance of his staff, will produce a script with the words for the \"Talking Points Memo\" and \"Tip of the Day\" segments, and points of discussion and questions for the guests that will appear on the program.</p>",

In 1996, when Raimy was 8 years old, NYPD Officer Frank Sullivan left Raimy and her mother, Julie, behind when he went deep undercover, got corrupted, and got himself killed. Or so the story has always gone. Few people knew about the secret undercover sting operation Frank was really charged with, led by Stan Moreno, who has now risen to Deputy Chief of Police. Frank's former partner, Lieutenant Satch Reyna, is now Raimy's mentor and friend, and he has urged her to let go of the hurt and anger she still feels about Frank's disappearance and death, but the old pain still lingers. Raimy can barely bring herself to discuss Frank, even with her devoted boyfriend, Daniel, or her childhood friend, Gordo. Now, twenty years later, Raimy is stunned when a voice suddenly crackles through her father's old, long-broken ham radio - it's Frank, somehow transmitting over the airwaves and through the decades from 1996. They're both shocked and confused, but Raimy shakes Frank to the core when she warns him that the secret sting he is undertaking will lead to his death. Armed with that knowledge, Frank survives the attempt on his life. But changing history has dramatically affected Raimy's life in the present - and there have been tragic consequences. Separated by 20 years, father and daughter have reunited on a frequency only they can hear, but can they rewrite the story of their lives without risking everyone they love?.</p>",

This time, however, the recruits are seven celebrities who can showcase their talents on TV and in movies, but not no so much in the kitchen. Burrell competes against <strong><em>\"Worst Cooks in America\" </em></strong>newcomer Rachael Ray to see which chef can lead one contestant to make the most impressive culinary transformation. Actors Dean Cain, Ellen Cleghorne, Jaleel White and Barry Williams join reality stars Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley, Chris Soules and Kendra Wilkinson in boot camp. The winning star gets $50,000 for charity and bragging rights for his or her mentor. Not all of the celebrities will make the cut, however; after an opening potluck dinner each mentor selects three recruits to be on her team, leaving one celebrity to be sent home before the competition really begins. Burrell is looking to extend her record to 5-2, while Ray looks to get the win in her first season.</p>",

By his side is his young, vivacious second wife Gloria, who resists his old-fashioned ways -- an impulse that will become all the more interesting now that he and Gloria have a new baby of their own. This exciting addition will bring more adventures to the family just as Gloria's son, Manny, is about to embark on an adventure of his own as he enters high school. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, also have their son, Luke, heading to high school; their middle daughter, Alex, is full steam ahead on the college track, and the eldest, Haley, is back home figuring out her future. With the kids all growing up, this new chapter means Claire can explore returning to the workforce, which will have its fair share of missteps and victories. And this will be a big year for Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, who alongside his loving partner, Cameron, and daughter Lily, will have a lot of reasons to celebrate. Together these three families give us an honest and often hilarious look into the sometimes warm, sometimes twisted, embrace of the modern family.</p>",

Told through the lens of the fictionalized, first-person perspectives of the victims, <em>Betrayed </em>treats the viewer like the only confidant they have left. As investigators, family, and friends peel back the layers and facts of each case, the otherworldly narrator already knows where the breadcrumb trail ends. They guide viewers through the various relationships that comprise their life, raising suspicions about who will commit the ultimate betrayal and bring about their doom.</p>",

Over the course of the season, viewers will see if the entrepreneurs have the ambition, creativity, and hustle necessary to succeed -- and in so doing, help a neighborhood that desperately needs investment. <strong><em>\"Cleveland Hustles\" </em></strong>is produced by SpringHill Entertainment and Magical Elves with LeBron James and Maverick Carter as executive producers for SpringHill Entertainment and Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz as executive producers for Magical Elves.

            "summary": "<p>CODE BLACK is a heart-pounding medical drama that takes place in the busiest, most notorious ER in the nation, where the staggering influx of patients can outweigh the limited resources available to the extraordinary doctors and nurses whose job is to treat them all - creating a condition known as Code Black. At the heart of the ER's controlled chaos is Residency Director Dr. Leanne Rorish, renowned for successfully performing high-risk procedures in Center Stage, the trauma area reserved for the most critical cases. Her four new first-year residents are Christa Lorenson, Malaya Pineda, Mario Savetti and Angus Leighton. Leanne's confidante, Jesse Sallander, is an amiable seen-it-all senior nurse who manages the residents. Also working in the ER is Dr. Neal Hudson, an excellent physician who sometimes disagrees with Leanne's \"cowboy\" approach, and Dr. Rollie Guthrie, the energetic, longest-serving attending. In Center Stage, life is measured in seconds, and these heroic doctors and nurses operate with speed and skill within an overwhelmed system to treat the crowds of people who are often there for one of two reasons: to die or to receive a life-saving miracle. </p>",

These are their stories.\"</em></p><p>At the center of \"Chicago P.D.\" is Det. Sgt. Hank Voight (Jason Beghe), who is at ground zero against the war on crime in Chicago. He will do anything to bring criminals to justice.</p><p>From multiple Emmy Award-winning executive producer Dick Wolf and the team behind the hit series \"Chicago Fire,\" \"Chicago P.D.\" is a riveting police drama about the men and women of the Chicago Police Department's elite Intelligence Unit, combatting the city's most heinous offenses - organized crime, drug trafficking, high-profile murders and beyond.</p><p>Hand-picked as the head of the unit is Voight, who has assembled a team of diverse detectives who share his passion and commitment to keep the city safe. They include Det. Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda), who is more level-headed and \"by the book\" than his counterpart; Det. Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer), a brash young cop who previously saw active military duty in Afghanistan; Halstead's partner Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush), a former \"bad girl\" who turned her life around with Voight's help; Det. Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas), an experienced undercover detective and confidante for Voight; Adam Ruzek (Patrick John Flueger), a quick-witted cadet plucked from the police academy as Olinsky's partner; and Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins), a charismatic patrolman who recently was brought upstairs.</p><p>Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati) and her new partner, Julie Tay (Li Jun Li), assist with the unit but on a daily basis work the streets as uniform patrol officers often cooperating with intelligence whenever necessary. Desk Sgt. Trudy Platt (Amy Morton) runs a tight precinct with tough love, although she lets her softer more vulnerable side shine through from time to time.</p><p>In addition to Wolf, executive producers include Matt Olmstead, Peter Jankowski, Michael Brandt, Derek Haas, Mark Tinker and Arthur Forney.</p><p>\"Chicago P.D.\" is produced by Wolf Films in association with Universal Television.</p>",

One of the major differences between network news and the PBS NewsHour is that because the show is publicly funded, there are no commercials. This allows the NewsHour to dedicate more time to comprehensive reporting. The nightly broadcast features a two-anchor format, with a rotation of NEWSHOUR senior correspondents Gwen Ifill, Judy Woodruff and Jeffrey Brown. Senior correspondents Margaret Warner and Ray Suarez deliver compelling original reporting & newsmaker interviews from the field. Correspondent Hari Sreenivasan delivers news to the digital world and anchors the news summary on the television broadcasts.</p>",

            "summary": "<p>\"<i><strong>Hannity & Colmes\"</strong></i> was a live television show on Fox News Channel in the United States, hosted by Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes, who respectively presented a conservative and liberal perspective. The series premiered on October 7, 1996, and the final episode aired on January 9, 2009. It was the precursor to the <i>Hannity </i>program, which airs in the same time slot. The show offered Hannity's conservative views and Colmes's liberal views incorporated into a current news story, or in conjunction with a featured guest.</p><p>In addition to politics, the show featured debate about soft news stories, such as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal or the death of Anna Nicole Smith, or one-on-one interviews with politicians, commonly with the host who most closely shared the guest's political ideology. The show's format resembled a former CNN show called <i>Crossfire</i>, which similarly had co-hosts on both the left and right.</p><p>Fox announced on November 24, 2008 that Alan Colmes would leave the show at the end of the year, but he remains a commentator on Fox News, runs the blog Liberaland, and makes occasional appearances on other programs like <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, and Shovio.com's <i>TalkBackTV</i>. On December 11, it was announced that Hannity would take over the time slot alone with a new show simply titled <i>Hannity</i>, which would have a format closer to his weekend program <i>Hannity's America</i>. January 9, 2009 was the last airing of <i>Hannity & Colmes</i>, with January 12 marking the beginning of the new <strong><em>\"<i>Hannity\"</i> </em></strong>program.</p>",

Just when he's about to end his misery and jump off a bridge, a reverend shows up and talks him down. When the reverend slips off the bridge and falls to his death, he leaves Buddy with the unlikely opportunity to steal the man's identity and pose as the new gay pastor of a small, tight-knight town, leaving his bartender ex-girlfriend Leanne to clean up the huge mess he left behind. Buddy begins to settle into his new life as a pastor with the help of his preppy new assistant Dora, alluring church treasurer Alexa and enthusiastic secretary Russell - but the church president, Alden Schmidt senses that something isn't quite right. Curing sex crazed teenagers, stealing kids' weed and reading Bible scripture may not be a bad gig for Buddy after all. Only time will tell how long he can keep up the facade. </p>",

News Live</strong></i>, is the flagship entertainment newscast of the E! network in the United States. Without italics, it is the name of the network's entertainment-news division. The newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reports on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, and some news about the industry in general. The program first aired on September 1, 1991 and was originally hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named <i>E! News Live</i>). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by Jason Kennedy. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), leaving others to question if she would return. But Rancic reassured her fans by releasing a statement saying she had just signed a three-year deal with E! News and Fashion Police. During her leave, her anchoring duties were taken over by Catt Sadler. From 2006 until late 2010, <i>The Daily 10</i>, hosted by Sal Masekela, Catt Sadler, and at one point Debbie Matenopoulos, aired following <i>E! News</i>.</p><p>On September 21, 2010, E! announced the cancellation of <i>The Daily 10</i>. At this time, it was announced that <i>E! News</i> would be expanded to a one-hour format. The expansion became effective beginning on October 25, 2010, making it one of two entertainment news programs to have weekday editions that air in an hour-long format,HLN's <i>Showbiz Tonight</i> being the other. The series also debuted a new news set and began broadcasting in 16:9 high definition, downconverted to 4:3 letterbox (with pillarboxing for 4:3 SD video) on the channel's primary SD feed.[1] Some talent previously featured on <i>The Daily 10</i>, including Catt Sadler, Clinton Sparks and Robbie Laughlin, were integrated into <i>E! News</i>, along with the addition of a segment called <i>The Daily 10 Take</i>, along with the inclusion of some former <i>Daily 10</i> segments.</p><p><i>E! News</i> does not produce episodes on major holidays, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas, with special pre-taped programs, the show's weekend edition or other E! programs airing instead, depending on where the holiday falls. </p>",

Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed <em>\"The Colbert Report\"</em>, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!</p>",
